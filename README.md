🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning
_____________________________________________________________

📌 Project Overview
______________________

- Rice is one of the most important crops worldwide. Leaf diseases directly affect crop yield and farmer income.
  
- This project uses Deep Learning with TensorFlow to automatically detect rice leaf diseases from images.

- The model classifies rice leaves into three disease categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

🎯 Objectives :-
_____________________

- Detect rice leaf diseases from images.

- Reduce dependency on manual inspection.

- Improve early disease identification.

- Provide a scalable AI-based solution for agriculture.

🦠 Disease Classes :-
________________________

The model predicts the following classes:

- Bacterial Leaf Blight

- Brown Spot

- Leaf Smut

🧠 Technology Stack :-
___________________________

- Programming Language: Python

- Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

- IDE: Jupyter Notebook

- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

- Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
